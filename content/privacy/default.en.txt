In accordance with art. 13 GDPR the Data Controller hereby provides you (the Data Subject) with information about how your data is processed.\n\n**1. Purpose and Legal Basis for the Data Processing**\n\nYour personal data will be processed for the following purposes:\n\nthe efficient organization and management of your participation and registration to the event (e.g. conference, seminar, training course, workshop, meeting etc.) including the preparation and follow-up actions and communications about the event and related institutional information and networking and the processing and compliance with pre-contractual and with contract related requirements;\ndocumentation of the event for institutional, archiving and communication purposes, but not for commercial purposes, (concerning data revealing the person’s image and voice, e.g. video, audio, photographic, recordings), including, but not limited to presentations, reporting documents, creation of informative material, communication activities using any forms and media, such as web pages and social networks;\nfor the purpose of the emergency management and prevention of COVID-19 infection, including the “Shared Protocol for the Regulation of Measures to Combat and Contain the Spread of the Covid-19 Virus in Workplaces” signed on 14 March 2020. The data controller may contact you to inform you of any COVID-19 cases that have occurred in participants who were present at the event.\nThe legal basis for the processing of your personal data for the purposes indicated above is a) the performance of the contract to which the data subject is party (participation on the event) b) the consent to the processing of your data and c) the need to comply with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject, namely the implementation of anti-contagion safety protocols pursuant to Art. 1 (7) (d) DPCM dated 11 March 2020.\n\n**2.

Mandatory or Voluntary Communication of Data and Possible Consequences of a Failure to Provide it**\n\nThe provision of personal data is voluntary, but refusal could interfere with the correct performance of the purposes, thus rendering the participation on the event impossible.  \n\n**4.

This document provides information on the use of cookies and similar technologies, how they are used by the website and how to manage them.\n\n**Definitions**\n\nCookies are small text files that sites visited by users send to their terminals, where they are stored in order to be retransmitted to the same sites on the next visit. Third-party cookies, on the other hand, are set by a website other than the one the user is visiting. This is because on each site there may be elements (images, maps, sounds, specific links to web pages of other domains, etc.) that reside on servers other than that of the site visited.\n\n**Types of cookies**\n\nAccording to the characteristics and use of cookies, several categories can be distinguished:\n\n– Technical cookies. Technical cookies are those used for the sole purpose of \"carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communication network, or to the extent strictly necessary for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide such service\" (see Art. 122, paragraph 1, of the Code).They are not used for any further purposes and are normally installed directly by the website owner or operator. They can be subdivided into navigation or session cookies, which guarantee normal navigation and use of the website; analytics cookies, assimilated to technical cookies where they are used directly by the website operator to collect information, in aggregate form, on the number of users and on how they visit the website itself; functionality cookies, which allow the user to navigate according to a series of selected criteria in order to improve the service rendered to the same. Users' prior consent is not required for the installation of such cookies, while the obligation to provide information pursuant to Article 13 of the Code remains in place, which the site operator, if it only uses such devices, may provide in the manner it deems most appropriate.\n\n– Profiling cookies. Profiling cookies are designed to create profiles of users and are used to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the user while browsing the web. Due to the particular invasiveness that such devices may have in the private sphere of users, European and Italian legislation provides that the user must be adequately informed about their use and thus express his valid consent. They are referred to in Article 122 of the Code where it provides that \"the storage of information in the terminal equipment of a contracting party or user or access to information already stored shall only be permitted on condition that the contracting party or user has expressed consent after having been informed in the simplified manner set out in Article 13(3)\" (Article 122(1) of the Code). This site does not use profiling cookies.\n\n\n**Third-party cookies**\n\nBy visiting this website you may receive cookies from sites operated by other organisations ('third parties'). One example is the presence of 'social plug-ins' for Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn, or embedded (integrated) media display systems such as Youtube, Flikr. These are parts generated directly by the aforementioned sites and integrated into the web page of the host site visited. The presence of these plug-ins involves the transmission of cookies to and from all sites operated by third parties. The management of the information collected by 'third parties' is governed by the relevant policies to which please refer. For the sake of transparency and convenience, the web addresses of the different policies and cookie management methods are listed below.\n\nFacebook information: https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies/ \nFacebook (configuration): log in to your account.

It may resort to the use of cookies, both permanent and not, for the purpose of collecting statistical information and 'unique visitors' to the site. These cookies, defined as \"Unique Visitor Cookies\", contain an alphanumeric code that identifies browsing computers, but do not collect any personal data.\n\n**Google Analytics**\n\nThe site also includes components transmitted by Google Analytics, a web traffic analysis service provided by Google, Inc. ('Google'). These cookies are used for the sole purpose of monitoring and improving the performance of the site. For further information, please refer to the link below:\n\nhttps://www.google.it/policies/privacy/partners/\n\nYou can selectively disable the action of Google Analytics by installing the opt-out component provided by Google on your browser. To disable the action of Google Analytics, please refer to the link below:\n\nhttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\n\n**Cookie Duration**\n\nSome cookies (session cookies) remain active only until the browser is closed or any logout command is executed. Other cookies \"survive\" when the browser is closed and are available on subsequent visits by the user. These cookies are called persistent and their duration is fixed by the server when they are created. In some cases an expiry date is set, in other cases the duration is unlimited.\n\n**Cookie Management**\n\nYou can decide whether or not to accept cookies by using your browser settings. \nAttention: total or partial disabling of technical cookies may affect the optimal use of the site. \nDisabling \"third-party\" cookies does not affect navigability in any way.\nThe setting can be defined specifically for different websites and web applications. Furthermore, browsers allow different settings to be defined for 'proprietary' and 'third-party' cookies. As an example, in Firefox, through the menu Tools->Options->Privacy, it is possible to access a control panel where it is possible to define whether or not to accept different types of cookies and to proceed to their removal. Documentation on how to set cookie management rules for one's own browser is readily available on the Internet; by way of example, here are some addresses for the main browsers: \n\nChrome: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=it \nFirefox: https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/Gestione%20dei%20cookie \nInternet Explorer: http://windows.microsoft.com/it-it/windows7/how-to-manage-cookies-in-internet-explorer-9 \nOpera: http://help.opera.com/Windows/10.00/it/cookies.html \nSafari: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1677?viewlocale=it_IT\n \n ","text2a":"","text2b":"","text3a":"","text3b":"","text3c":"","marginbottom":"true"},"id":"3e12a7e1-7f07-4f7f-a546-f3f5b230acdb","isHidden":false,"type":"multicolumns"}]
