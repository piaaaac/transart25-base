Title: Experiences

----

Intro: The 23rd edition of Transart also includes a variety of *EXPERIENCES*, *free events* designed for the immersive participation of the public: conversations and meetings with artists, workshops, laboratories for children, an exhibition, site-specific architecture and much more. All of the experiences in our program can be experienced at **Transart OASIE**â€”a hub for creative exchange in the heart of Bolzano.
